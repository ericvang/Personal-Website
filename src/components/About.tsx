              Originally from Brooklyn Park, MN. I am currently a rising junior at UW-Madison studying Computer Science and Data Science.

            <p>
            My work spans across full-stack development, machine learning, and inclusive design. Iâ€™ve used tools like Python, JavaScript, Flask, React, Unity, and scikit-learn in projects ranging from hackathons to academic projects. 
            My current occupation is a Start-Up SWE Intern at DarkHorse Solutions LLC where I am working on a RFID Project, an AI-Developer at the UW-Madison SAIL program sponsored by OpenAI, and an Adaptive Technology Assistant at the McBurney Center.

              When I'm not coding, you'll find me working out, enjoying the outdoors, taking naps, and trying new foods!
