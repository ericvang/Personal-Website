              Originally from Brooklyn Park, MN. I am currently a junior at UW-Madison studying Computer Science and Data Science.

            <p>
            My work spans across full-stack development, machine learning, and inclusive design. Iâ€™ve used tools like Python, JavaScript, Flask, React, Unity, and scikit-learn in projects ranging from hackathons to academic projects. 
            I also work as an Adaptive Technology Assistant, where I help convert educational materials into formats accessible for students with disabilities.

              When I'm not coding, you'll find me working out, taking naps, and trying new foods.
